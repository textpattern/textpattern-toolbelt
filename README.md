## Textpattern release build process

When it comes time to bundle up a development version for release, the following process should be followed to ensure smooth continued development.

#### Notes

* Semantic versioning is adopted with major.minor.patch standards.
* Development code is suffixed `-dev`.
* Beta code is suffixed `-beta`, `-beta.2`, `-beta.3`, ...
* Any reference to `x.y.z` below refers to the version number and may be suffixed as mentioned.

### Step 1

From the dev branch, create a `release-x.y.z` branch for the new version:

```
git checkout -b release-x.y.z dev
```

### Step 2

Update HISTORY.txt and write an announcement for the blog, forum, and the mailinglist txp-announce@ (don't post yet).

### Step 3

Update version numbers in:
* `README.txt`
* `README.md`
* The `version` pref val in `textpattern/vendors/Textpattern/DB/Data/core.prefs`.

* Theme manifests.

### Step 4

Check for files containing Windows line-endings (`\r\n`) and convert those to Unix-style. Prevents false 'modified files' alarms for uploads done in FTP ASCII mode.

### Step 5

Because upgrade scripts don't run on new installs, make sure the contents of the `setup` directory is completely in sync with all that's done in the /update scripts. Most of this is handled automatically but any per-user prefs or values injected form the setup process may need to be added by hand.

### Step 6

Commit all changes with commit message:

```
HISTORY and version numbers for x.y.z
```

### Step 7

Edit `/textpattern/index.php` to bump main version number.

**Most importantly:**

Release type | Note
------------ | ----
Stable | Set `$txp_is_dev` to `false`, then commit.
Beta | Leave `$txp_is_dev` at `true`, then commit.

### Step 8

Run `checksums.php` from textpattern-toolbelt and commit:

```php
php /path/to/textpattern-toolbelt/release/checksums.php /path/to/dev/textpattern rebuild
```

### Step 9

Copy the entire bundle to a local directory and test. Things to look for:

1. New installation/setup works.
2. Upgrade from (populated) recent versions works.
3. Multi-site installations work.
4. Automated installations work.
5. Version numbers are reported correctly throughout.
6. The High Diagnostics panel reports everything correctly.
7. Public tags provide expected output.
8. Runs on as manay versions of PHP, MySQL (or off-brand equivalents), Apache, Nginx.
9. Left over files that need deleting.

Fix anything that doesn't work, and commit changes to the `release-x.y.z` branch. Run checksums again if required and commit.

### Step 10

Merge to master:

```bash
git checkout master
git merge release-x.y.z
git push
```

### Step 11

Run build script. It will build a package (zip) file in a temporary location and report where that is. Supply a second argument if you wish to override this destination.

```bash
cd /path/to/repo
/path/to/textpattern-toolbelt/release/txp-gitdist.sh x.y.z
```

### Step 12

Verify package has been built correctly, including symlink verification in the `/sites` directory. Unzip it to check. An SHA256 checksum file is automatically built for the download package.

### Step 13

Prepare a release for version x.y.z on GitHub:
* Set the tag to just the vanilla version number `x.y.z` along with any required `-beta` suffix.
* Ensure the target select box is `master`.
* Use the same tag name for the release Title, but prefix it with a lower case `v`.
* Attach package and SHA256 checksum.
* If it's a beta, ensure the `Pre-release` checkbox is set.

Use `git pull` to bring the new tag down to your local repo.

### Step 14

Upload package to textpattern.com website. Ensure it complies with the semantic filename versioning rules.

Select the appropriate file category for the download:

```
Current release
Current beta release
```

Make sure the `Title` and `Description` fields are filled out correctly (see previous files for examples of this).

### Step 15

Remove the category assignment from previous uploads of a beta / stable releases. Note you can have a stable release and a beta release at the same time, but it's good housekeeping to remove old categories from previous releases. Everything is built automatically based on these category assignments.

### Step 16

When writing the corresponding article, use the shortcode as follows:

```html
notextile. <txp::media_file filename="textpattern-x.y.z.zip" sha256="a868c05fc37108f2bb5e878cfbcdc61a82ce2646c4676cccb8105a6c6277be7a" />
```

### Step 17

Add a section to the 'Get started' article when a beta is available (remove it from here at the end of the beta cycle but leave it in its dedicated article for posterity).

### Step 18

Prepare for ongoing development:

```bash
git checkout release-x.y.z
```

### Step 19

Edit `/textpattern/index.php` to bump version number to next release. Ensure it has `-dev` suffix.
If this release is a beta, it's okay to revert the version number to the same `x.y.z-dev` it was before.

### Step 20

Set `$txp_is_dev` to `true` if it was previously `false`. Commit regardless to ensure version change is applied.

### Step 21

Merge release to dev so any changes in the release are recorded:

```bash
git checkout dev
git merge release-x.y.z
git push
```

### Step 22

Delete release branch as it has served its purpose.

```bash
git branch -d release-x.y.z
```

You might have to use `-D` switch if the branch deletion complains it's 'unmerged': that's because we just modified it ready for returning to dev. It depends if the release branch was pushed to the central repo or not. If so:

```bash
git push origin â€”-delete release-x.y.z
```

### Step 23

Post announcements to forum / twitter / relevant social media.

### Step 24

Search through all textpattern.com articles to update any outdated version numbers (in case articles were written in advance or features got moved between versions, or reference the download itself).

### Step 25

Light cigar and wait for the fallout. Sleep.
